## Description
This JavaScript Quiz is a simple quiz game that challenges the player to answer ten questions in one minute. The quiz has a timer that ticks down ten seconds for every incorrect answer the palyer selects. The quiz also allows the player to track their high scores and clear the scores if needed.

Gameplay:
The JavaScript Quiz is a multiple-choice quiz that asks ten questions related to JavaScript programming. The player has one minute to answer all ten questionsxs. For every incorrect answer, the timer takes away ten seconds from the remaining time. If the player answers all ten questions within the allotted time, they win the game.

High Scores:
The quiz also allows the player to keep track of their high score. When the player completes the quiz, their score is compared to the current high score. If their score is higher, the high score is updated, and the player's name is added to the high score list. The quiz also has an option to clear the high scores, which erases all the player's high scores.

Technical Details:
The JavaScript Quiz is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz uses DOM manipulation to display the questions, timer, and high scores. The quiz also uses JavaScript's built-in setInterval() function to create a timer that counts down from one minute. The quiz uses arrays to store the questions, answer options, and correct answers. The high scores are stored in the browser's local storage using JavaScript's localStorage object
